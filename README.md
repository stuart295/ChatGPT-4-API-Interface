# ChatGPT-4-API-Interface
## Introduction
A super-basic flask app that provides an ChatGPT-like interface to the OpenAI API. 

If you have access to the GPT4 APIs, then this app allows you to use the GPT4 model in a ChatGPT-like way without needing ChatGPT plus. As a bonus, there are no message limits for the API and you are billed based on your actual usage.

## Installation
To use this:
1. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create a `secrets.txt` file in the root directory containing an active OpenAI API key. Not great, I know.
3. Run the flask app: `python app.py`
